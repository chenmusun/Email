 * @brief		Definitions for image functionality.<br>
 *				Definitions and functions in this module are included in fs_image_r.h and fs_image_w.h.<br>
 *				Module: Image<br>
 *				License Identifier: Image/All<br>
 *				Available License Right: Reading/Writing<br>
 *				For license Right <b>Reading</b>, see fs_image_r.h.<br>
 *				For license Right <b>Writing</b>, see fs_image_w.h.
 * @details		This module contains the following features:<br>
 *				<ul>
 *				<li>1. Bitmap:
 *					<ul>
 *					<li>a. Create or release a bitmap object, retrieve bitmap data, transform a bitmap, 
 *						   conversion of bitmap formats and calculate the bounding box of bitmap contents.</li>
 *					<li>b. Bitmap is one of most important data structures in Foxit PDF SDK. It's commonly used for rendering PDF pages.</li>
 *					<li>c. Note: On several platforms, there are different bitmap formats defined, 
 *						   but it's very important to ensure performance to use compatible formats defined by Foxit PDF SDK in applications.</li>
 *					</ul>
 *				</li>
 *				<li>2. Image reading:
 *					<ul>
 *					<li>a. Load an image file, retrieve an image file format, get frame data and image properties (EXIF informations).</li>
 *					<li>b. Foxit PDF SDK supports six formats of image files:<br>
 *						   BMP, bitmap image files;<br>
 *						   JPG, joint photographic experts group image files;<br>
 *						   PNG, portable network graphics image files;<br>
 *						   GIF, graphics interchange format image files;<br>
 *						   TIF, tagged image file format;<br>
 *						   JPX, JPEG-2000 image files.</li>
 *					<li>c. Note: Only GIF and TIF images support multiple frames, while the others only support single frame.</li>
 *					</ul>
 *				</li>
 *				<li>3. Image writing:
 *					<ul>
 *					<li>a. Create an image file, add a frame into a bitmap, and set image properties (EXIF informations).</li>
 *					<li>b. Foxit PDF SDK doesn't support to create an image file with GIF format.</li>
 *					<li>c. Note: For all supported image formats here, only TIF image supports multiple frames, 
 *								 the others only support a single frame.</li>
 *					</ul>
 *				</li>
 *				</ul>
