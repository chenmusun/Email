 * @brief	Header file for \ref FPDFANNOT "PDF Annotation" module of Foxit PDF SDK.
 * @details	This header file defines PDF annotation supports, mainly about "writing" methods.<br>
 *			It contains:<br>
 *			<ul>
 *			<li>1. Add and remove annotations. </li>
 *			<li>2. Set properties of annotations. </li>
 *			<li>3. Supports to markup annotations. </li>
 *			<li>4. Set annotation trigger actions.</li>
 *			<li>5. Reset appearance of annotation.</li>
 *			</ul><br>
 *			Special attention:
 *			<ul>
 *			<li>
 *				For watermark annotation, it can be set properties 
 *				but cannot be added , removed or reset appearance by using functions in this header file.<br>
 *				User is suggested to use functions in \ref FPDFWATERMARK "PDF Watermark" module for most operations of watermark.<br>
 *			</li>
 *			<li>
 *				For PSInk annotation, it can be removed, set properties or reset appearance
 *				but cannot be added by using functions in this header file.<br>
 *				User should use function ::FSCRT_PSI_ConvertToPDFAnnot in \ref FSPSI "Pressure Sensitive Ink" to generate a PSInk annotation from a PSI object.<br>
 *			</li>
 *			<li>
 *				For Sound, Movie, Screen, PrinterMark, TrapNet and 3D annotations, they can be set basic properties and removed, 
 *				but cannot be added or reset appearance. Currently Foxit PDF SDK doesn't support to set their data.
 *			</li>
 *			<li>
 *				For annotation which is not defined in PDF Reference but consists of some standard annotations, 
 *				it will be treated as different standard annotations.
 *				If user wants to treat these standard annotations as one special annotation, user should do this in application layer.
 *			</li>
 *			</ul>
 *
 * @note	If you want to purchase Foxit PDF SDK license and use ANY of the following functions, please request for enabling <b>Annotation Add-on</b> explicitly.

 * @details		This module contains following features:<br>
 *				<ul>
 *				<li>1. Annotation:
 *					<ul>
 *					<li>a.	Load, add or remove annotations in page, enumerate annotations by filter, access common properties of annotations, 
 *							control markups, access trigger actions of annotations, render annotations or reset appearance.</li>
 *					<li>b.	Annotations contain a lot of interactive operations in PDF. They increase practicability and provide valuable extension to applications. 
 *							Markup consists of several advanced features which involve contents and replies, state, group managements. 
 *							Widget is a special type of annotation which represents a terminal node of PDF form field. 
 *							In Foxit PDF SDK, form control is a synonym to widget.</li>
 *					<li>c.	Note: 
 *							<ul>
 *							<li>Sound, Movie, Screen, PrinterMark, TrapNet and 3D annotations are not fully supported in the current version of Foxit PDF SDK. 
 *								Current functions only provide common access to them, not support access to their data.</li>
 *							<li>Widget and watermark annotations: Foxit PDF SDK only provides common access to widget , watermark and PSInk annotation in this module. <br>
 *								For widget related to form object, please refer to \ref FPDFFORM "PDF Form" module.<br>
 *								For watermark annotation, please refer to \ref FPDFWATERMARK "PDF Watermark" module. <br>
 *								For PSInk annotation, please refer to \ref FSPSI "Pressure Sensitive Ink" </li>
